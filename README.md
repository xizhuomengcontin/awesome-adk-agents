> Welcome to **Awesome ADK Agents**👋👋

A comprehensive ecosystem resource for Google's Agent Development Kit - one of the fastest-growing agentic AI frameworks, with 20K+ stars, 3.6K+ forks, and thousands of dependent projects. Whether you're exploring AI agents for the first time or deploying production multi-agent systems, this collection provides vetted implementations, learning paths, and deployment patterns from Google's official team and a vibrant global community.

## 🎯 What This List Solves

Building production-ready AI agents with Google's ADK shouldn't require starting from scratch or piecing together fragmented tutorials. This curated collection addresses three critical challenges that slow down agent development:

### 1. **Template Discovery & Quality Gap**

- **Problem**: Most developers waste weeks searching for reliable starting points and end up with toy examples that don't scale
- **Solution**: Curated, battle-tested templates and real-world implementations you can actually build upon

### 2. **Production Readiness Barrier**

- **Problem**: Tutorials teach basics, but deploying robust, scalable agents requires understanding integration patterns, error handling, and deployment strategies
- **Solution**: Production-ready examples with complete implementation details, from development to deployment

### 3. **Implementation Learning Curve**

- **Problem**: The jump from "Hello World" tutorials to building meaningful solutions feels overwhelming
- **Solution**: Progressive examples that bridge theory and practice, showing how real developers solve actual problems

**Whether you're a beginner looking for solid foundations or an experienced developer seeking proven patterns, this repository eliminates the trial-and-error phase and accelerates your path to production-ready agents.**

## What is Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)?

**Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is Google's open-source, code-first Python framework for building production AI agents - backed by Google Cloud with tight Gemini integration while remaining fully model-agnostic (supports Claude, Ollama, LiteLLM). Launched in 2025, ADK has rapidly gained traction with 20K+ GitHub stars, frequent releases (currently v2.x, with the major ADK 2.0 milestone shipped), and adoption by thousands of projects, positioning itself as a serious alternative to established frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI. ADK is now available in Python, Go, Java, and TypeScript.

**Why ADK Matters:**

- **Google's Strategic Bet**: Deep integration with Vertex AI, Cloud Run, BigQuery, and Google's AI ecosystem
- **Production-First Design**: Built for enterprise deployment from day one, not research experiments  
- **Model Flexibility**: While optimized for the latest Gemini models, supports Anthropic Claude, Ollama, and any LLM via adapters
- **Active Innovation**: 200+ contributors, community hackathons with $50K prizes, and rapid feature development
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Official samples, third-party integrations (MongoDB, MCP, A2A protocol), and strong community momentum

### 🗝️ Key Features

- **🛠️ Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI specs, and Google ecosystem integration
- **💻 Code-First Development**: Define agents in Python with full testability and version control
- **🔗 Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Compose specialized agents into scalable hierarchies
- **🚀 Deploy Anywhere**: Cloud Run, Vertex AI Agent Engine, or any containerized environment
